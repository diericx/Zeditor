# Better timeline visuals, cut tool, hotkeys

- Introduce the concept of hotkeys
  - A is arrow which is or normal current state
  - B is the blade tool which turns the curser into a blade or sicors or something
    - A vertical line now follows the cursor whenever it is hovering over a clip
    - wherever I click it splits the clip into two
- Clips should have rounded corners and a thin dark gray border
- When dragging clips, if any overlap will trim another clip or split it or something, show that trim in real time in the UI so we can see what will happen when we lift our finger and commit the action.
- Do not let me even drag a clip to the left of 0. If I attempt to, stop the clip at 0 and let my mouse just move.
