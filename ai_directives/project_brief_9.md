# Saving and Loading projects

We now want the ability to save and load projects.

- Create a file type that will hold our project info
- By default open to an empty project called Untitled
  - NAme of project should be represented as the window title
- When you save a project from the menu, if the current project hasn't been saved open a file dialogue asking us where we want to put it
- Now that the project is named something else, change the window title
- When we save
  - the entire organization of the timeline should be captured
  - the list of clips loaded in to our source library should be saved
- Add the ability to load this info back up when we load a project
