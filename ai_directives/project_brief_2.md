# Foundations

Create the foundations for this app. Focus on setting up a test framework that will let you test every part you need INCLUDING video playback, video clip selection and adding them to the project, UI features like moving clips in the timeline, etc.

We want this entire app from end to end to be able to be tested by agents. Make that happen!

Use Rust as the language, and whatever UI framework or language you think is best to acheive this goal. I am looking for an end to end test framework and project structure that will set us up for success, not a working project.
