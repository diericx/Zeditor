# Small features and bug fixes

- Adding vertical video (rotated MOV) to the project that is currently set to 1920x1080 renders diagonal striped video in the preview
  - It seems to render with the correct letterboxing in the preview (looks like a vertical rectangle)
  - it should render in that same rectangle but with correct video pixels
- Clicking on videos in the project library (sources) (highlihgt in red) should select them and then I should be able to press delete to remove them from the library
  - If there are any clips in the timeline currently using them, have a pop up asking if I'm sure I want to delete them
- Clicking clips in the timeline should allow me to select them (highlight in red) should select them and let me delete them by pressing delete
- Video tracks should always be green while audio tracks are blue. Color should be the same every time you open the project not random.
